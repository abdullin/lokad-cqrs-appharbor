> document revision 2011-12-16 by Rinat Abdullin

This is local (via Ctrl-C + Ctrl-V) port of Salescast Maintenance
Utility for the purposes of this specific project. It allows 
to load Domain log and audit individual entries (synchronizing to 
the local cache, if needed).

Tool can operate either with local streams or remote streams.
